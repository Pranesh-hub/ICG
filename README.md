# Mindful Pick
In todayâ€™s consumer landscape, transparency and impact verification of everyday products, such as food,
cosmetics, and household cleaners, are crucial yet often overlooked aspects. These fast-moving consumer
goods (FMCGs), which dominate our daily lives, have significant implications for our health, environment,
animals etc.

Unfortunately, many mainstream FMCGs flooding the market are neither healthy nor eco-friendly, often con-
tributing to environmental degradation. Despite frequent reports on social media about the harmful effects
of these products, it is nearly impossible for consumers to keep track of such information when making purchasing decisions.

Mindful pick is a application which takes input from user as images and then instantly provides detailed
ratings and reviews from various sources.
